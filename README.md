# Rust Background
The best resource for getting an introduction to rust is [the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). You are free to use any other learning resources as well.

When writing code keep the following in mind:
- It should be [properly formatted](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)
- It should be [linted](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
- There should be no warnings
- The public API must be fully [documented](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html)
- The [API guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html) should be followed for library crates
- Follow best git practices
